## (2) Student Companion Android App

> I started this app as a Capstone Project of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree, but continoued to develop and add features to it untill 2019. This project is not maintained by me now. Here is description of app:

Student Companion is an app that has many features that are useful for students in school, High School or college.
### Features
- **Attendance Manager**
    - Manages attendance and reminds you to fill attendance, This can be useful to see the regularity of student or in some colleges with minimum attendance criteria.
- **NoteManager** 
    - Notes can be taken easily and later be edited or removed as per convenience by Note Manager. 
- **Market place** 
    - Market place is made through this app to post ads about your old books, vehicles, documents so that other people can use them and both will get the benefit. As there is no payment gateway included with the app user does not need to fill any pieces of information other than phone no to contact.
- **Digital library**
    - This feature ensures that the student has enough material to study if they can not afford books they should use the digital versions.
- **The Notification Manager** 
    - Notification Manager will warn the user if attendance goes lower or if there is an interesting event going on in college!
