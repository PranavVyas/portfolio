## (2) CCTV Monitering Dashboard

### Background:

- I started this project as a self initiative. I was incharge of CCTV monitering data (There was practise of HODs oberving cctv cameras and seding theirobservations via email to me, I then kept record in local excel file). This became hard to maintain as SHs are also involved later, which increased observer numbers and thus mails.
- So, I created microsoft power app to get details from HODs and SHs
- I have taken feedback from my stackholders (VP-Production, VP-Engineering, DH-Safety, LH-Technical Services) for details required to be filled in form (I had to read every observation and put in different 9 categories, now i have added this in form so manual reading of observation is also avoided)
- After I received enough data, I started with making dashboard in PowerBI. I deveoped dashboard and deployed on company server. This gave us what are most observed violations and helped by creating action plan for reduction

### Overview

- Data collection from section heads and above about observation done through CCTV of unsafe act
- Designed database, identified requirements and created forms for online data collection accessible from Phone or Web browser
- Categorized in 9 different categories and generate recommendations based on observations
- Report format made after discussion of stakeholders and shared on weekly basis
- Made insightful dashboard in PowerBI to see and moniter KPIs

### Screenshots

Here are some of the screen shots of dashboard:

## (3) Student Companion Android App

> I started this app as a Capstone Project of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree, but continoued to develop and add features to it untill 2019. This project is not maintained by me now. Here is description of app:

Student Companion is an app that has many features that are useful for students in school, High School or college.

    - Market place is made through this app to post ads about your old books, vehicles, documents so that other people can use them and both will get the benefit. As there is no payment gateway included with the app user does not need to fill any pieces of information other than phone no to contact.
- **Digital library**
    - This feature ensures that the student has enough material to study if they can not afford books they should use the digital versions.
- **The Notification Manager** 
    - Notification Manager will warn the user if attendance goes lower or if there is an interesting event going on in college!
- **Today's lecture Widget**
    - The widget provided with the app removes the headache of remembering the lectures by providing the lecture of that days right on the home screen. The widget will update at the midnight (around 12:00 AM) so it makes sure that you only see the latest day's timetable and also don't consume battery by frequently updating itself
- **Dark Theme (Available only in Paid Version)**
    - By Enabling the dark mode in the settings page you can use dark mode. Why us there Dark Mode ? Well It saves some battery on AMOLED Screens and main reason is It looks Cool 
- **Timetable & Holidays**
    - It is very easy to see time table of the whole week in the app. Just touch the hamburger menu (3 horizontal lines at top left corner) or swipe from left edge to right to open Navigation menu and than select timetable and you can see the timetable and select the holidays to see the holidays and details about holidays

### (6) XYZ Reader

> XYZ is a project done under Udacity Nanodegree Projects and redesigned app from the original app given by Udacity in the Nanodegree

- XYZ reader is feed reader app that uses Material Design Guidelines and new material design components for better UX to show very big articles at once in the app.
- The app is optimized by using recycler view to load text, in this way app stays efficient in memory and shows very big articles at once.
- The recycler view does not load all the items at once but recycles the item holders and caches them for further use, in this way the app uses very low memory (compared to normal list view or single text view) to load three articles each being more than 1000 lines from the internet!

## (13) PAI

> This app was developed when we did not had computer in our house. We had extra curricular classes as Computer subject in my town in my school. I joined these classes and whenever I am doe with teachers assignment, I worked on this project and some other C projects. Please keep in mind that this is written by me back when Computers were not populer in my town and only my school had 10 computers in our whole town. I was just learning the computer languages. I wanted to have orignal program here so I did not changed anything 

- PAI is written in C language which is basically early database of sentences.
- I have incorporated trial and paid mode in this also, For paid version user can set password which is stored in "base.obb" file and for creating OTP is required which is generated through an algorithm.
- OTPs are stored in OTP.txt file that is generated by program
- Database is stored in "file.obb"
- If value is found it returns values if not found it asks for input answers you want to display and stores inside local file

## (14) PKV website

> If the graphics looks old but this was made by me in Microsoft App, I don't remeber exctely now. But it was in 2013 when I coded this website in my schools computer in computer classes. There are many things written in this website which might be looking childish, Because it was made by a child who used this thing called computer for 3-4 months in intervals. I wanted to keep this as is so nothing is changed.

This is a HTML file, in which programming is done for with IF ELSE.
